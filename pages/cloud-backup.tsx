          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
          Data is the lifeblood of modern organizations. Losing access to
          critical files, customer records, or business applications can halt
          operations and damage your reputation. Cloud backup offers a reliable,
          scalable solution to protect your data and ensure business
          continuity—even in the face of disaster.

          What Is Cloud Backup?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Cloud backup is the process of storing copies of your data on remote
          servers managed by a cloud provider. Unlike traditional backups, cloud
          solutions are accessible from anywhere, automatically updated, and
          protected by advanced security measures.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>Automated backups reduce human error</li>
          <li>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
          <li>Access files from any device, anywhere</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-700 dark:text-purple-300">
          Why Cloud Backup Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          The risks of data loss are everywhere: hardware failure, cyberattacks,
          accidental deletion, and natural disasters. Cloud backup provides
          peace of mind by ensuring your data is always recoverable, no matter
          what happens.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li>Protects against ransomware and malware attacks</li>
          <li>Enables fast disaster recovery and minimal downtime</li>
          <li>Scales with your business as data grows</li>
          <li>Reduces costs compared to on-premises solutions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-700 dark:text-purple-300">
          Best Practices for Cloud Backup
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          To get the most from your cloud backup solution, follow these best
          practices:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">

          Real-World Example
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
          In 2023, a mid-sized retail company suffered a ransomware attack that
          encrypted all local files. Thanks to their cloud backup solution, they
          restored operations within hours, avoided paying a ransom, and
          maintained customer trust.
